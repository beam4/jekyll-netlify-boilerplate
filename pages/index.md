#### The structure of 'buildchurchsite.netlify.app'

Besides `home` page and `contact` page, [Tutorial](/tutorial) section provide informations on how to make website in case someone want to make the website by oneself, [Opinions](/opinions) section want to provide informations on how to use website to share a point to pastor in order to give some suggestions to pastor.

You would better visit [https://buildchurchsite.netlify.app](https://buildchurchsite.netlify.app) first.

The full web site life circle are in 3 stages, step 1 is building the site, step 2 is [handing over to pastor](/tutorial/hand-over), step 3 is using web site in various cases. The most difficult part is how to use web site, there is no textbook or theory on this, simply put, it is all about customers demands, to use web site, better know your customers is the key for competition.

#### The intention

This site is to build the God's church a web site, a web site is a standard requirement for any organization in digital age, this is a voluntary project in New Vision Church believers in Nuwakot Nepal.

#### The Approach

To build a church website, we use static approach,'static' means opposite to 'dynamic' website which has a database, the static website doesn't has a database, which make it less complicated and light-weight,there are similar services like [vercel](https://vercel.com/), [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [github pages](https://pages.github.com) and so on.

**We make website this way: select a template, edit in github.com and host in netlify.com**

#### A Sample Repository

There is a sample website: [Good News Church Nepal](https://goodnewschurchnp.netlify.app), the github repository is: [https://github.com/goodnewschurchnp/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate](https://github.com/goodnewschurchnp/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate)

You can folk and start.

#### The Information Site

Information website means the main function of the site provide information of the church.The information site suppose to be a start point for the pastor.

We will start from Information Website, if the pastor of the church has some idea other than the information function, that is good.

Local believers use phone to contact Pastor,the church website mainly function as a list of informations, the church serve for local people, the photoes goes to Facebook account or group and leave a link on website. All website are in this setup, there are home page and contact page along with outside Facebook account or group link.

#### Template  

What kind of template should we choose, in my mind there are some ways:

- responsive, automaticly layout change between mobile and desktop, good for mobile phone user.

- vertical layout, like an app, good for mobile phone user.

- a hero image on home page, a hero image is a big picture to show theme of the website.

- deployed in netlify.com, normally a church website need less update frequency, need simple interface, no need specific administrator, netlify.com suppose to be free to use upto some limitation, Jekyll (a popular Static Site Generator name) was in market in 2008, netlify.com appeared in 2014, so the website deployable in netlify.com means the template can be used free of charge,especially Jekyll template.

We will select different templates, first Jekyll then 11ty, next maybe Next.js, Next maybe Jigsaw. ( All are static statis generator name.)

#### Sections And Navigation

Follow the [Tutorial](/tutorial) if you want to deploy by yourself.

The most difficult part is how to use the site,how to run the site? We will share in [Opinions](/opinions) section as a starter.

We will introduce data and data analyze according our understanding, the data analysis are foundation of a website, we will use [Google Analytics](/tutorial/google-analytics).

We will briefly touch [domain name](/blog/domainname), an introduction and how to use domain name, a domain name usually cost about 10 USD a year
