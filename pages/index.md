To build a church website, we use static approach,'static' means opposite to "dynamic' website which has a database, the static website doesn't has a database, which make it less complicated and light-weight,there are similar services like [vercel](https://vercel.com/), [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [github pages](https://pages.github.com) and so on.

The guideline like this: select a template, edit in github.com and host in netlify.com 

What kind of template should we choose, in my mind there are some guidlines:

- responsive, automaticly layout change between mobile and desktop, good for mobile phone user.
- vertical layout, like an app, good for mobile phone user.
- deployed in netlify.com, normally a church website need less update frequency, need simple interface, netlify.com suppose to be free to use upto some limitation, Jekyll(a popular Static Site Generator name) was in market in 2008, netlify.com appeared in 2014, so the website deployable in netlify.com means the template can be used free of charge,especially Jekyll template.

Follow the [Tutorial]() if you want to deploy by yourself.

We will introduce data and data analyze according our understanding, that is foundation to use website.

We will briefly touch domain name, an introduction and how to use domain name, a domain name usually cost about 10 USD a year
