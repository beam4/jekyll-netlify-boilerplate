### The url of 'build church site' at: [https://buildchurchsite.netlify.app](https://buildchurchsite.netlify.app)

#### The Church Works Are Managed By Pastor

Every work in church ministry are managed by Pastor, similar a boss in a company.

#### The Hand Over Of Website Means A Beginning Of Next Stage

The delivery of website does not mean reaching a completion of website, the structure is fixed, how to use the website to better serve church is a great challenge. Both Pastor and site making project members have to experiment and practice various ways to meet the digital tactic requirements.

#### Pastor Must Practice In Organization Level

The digital approach is a big leap originate from internet, it is absolute different from the last generation practice, the traditional practice, normally the traditional practice is 'simulation', easy to understand, easy to copy, but the 'digital' approach is not very easy to understand, to observe. From competition perspective, the old generation approach can not beat new generation approach. Thus how to survive in strong competition will be a big problem. 

#### Want to Use Website Preaching Gospel Directly Is Not Realistic

There are lot of church websites putting themself into a sort of SEO(Search Engine Optimism), the direction is not correct.

- There are over one billion web sites on earth, it was impossible to be ranked higher at no cost or voluntary work.
- When people deal with religion matter, few people will use internet to answer their inner question.
- New generation are not derived from old generation, try to get support from other churches is wrong.

Presume the above conclusions are correct, compare with the past, the situation in front the pastor is totally new, the pastor shall:

- Don't deal with evey matter by himself alone, he shall assign different taskes to different people, the pastor are decision making role.
- Let web site do some small works, like providing church informations, Sunday school informations, fund rising informations, contact informations, like that.
- Don't give up Spirit, even the spirit world are not visible, being survival in fierce competition, need help from spirit, otherwise one will failed.


#### The Website Hand Over Process

- The website consist only home page and contact page, the contents are in markdown format,no need to know HTML or CSS to compose the content.
- The pastor can check the contents of the web site or the 'Google Analytics' to meet his requirements.
- We use an email to register github.com and netlify.com account, it was a gmail account, we use it in 'Google Analytics'.It suppose not to be a private email, the pastor may use this email to collaborate with someone else. We hand over the gmail account to the pastor, and without the pastor's permision, we will not log in the church email account.
