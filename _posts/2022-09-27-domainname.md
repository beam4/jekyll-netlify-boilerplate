Domain Name can be seen as an url(uniform resource locator), usually we call it net address, shorten service, often we bought from a domain name service company, in case our url was long, not easy to remember to spread, we want to change it into a shorter name, we also consider a permanent url.There are many this kind of service companies in Nepal, they were agent companies of this kind,normally a .com domain name cost usd10 each year,.org are similar, you can search internet to find one,

Domain Name seemed sold to someone,actually it was lease, neither own the domain name nor purchase the domain name, but one may think my web addrss belong to me, that is not true, only you can use it, once one year was full, you have to renew for another year.

My advice is once your website published,not find a domain name immediately, you would better wait say one month or two,for example the present domain name https://goodnewschurchnp.netlify.app not bad than https://www.goodnewschurchnp.org,the former can be visited even you use the later,the later suppose to be spread easier, there are suppose over a billion websites on earth, no any diffrence if add up one new website.

If you are searching a domain name for your church, you can use one of domain name service company's website to check domain name availability. For example, if I want to know whether https://www.goodnews.church available or not, I will go to https://www.godaddy.com to check the domain name availibility, you have your choice or search internet.
