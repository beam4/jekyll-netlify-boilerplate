## Website and background

- HTML and Markdown file

All web pages are in HTML format, these can be viewed by 'source code' by a web browser, the HTML format is actually a text file, can be viewed by a web browser, the Markdown format file will convert to HTML file, to be regnize by web browser, HTML file are not human regnize friendly, the Markdown file is human regnize friendly,so you write in Markdown format and translate to HTML for web browser. The Markdown format you can search internet, search 'markdown cheatsheet' is ok.

There is a site for learning many computer topics at :https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ , you can find topics like HTML,CSS and more.

- CMS

Softwares to make the website called 'CMS'(content management system), the famous are Wordpress, Drupal,Lateral, Typ03,and many, most them are open source, menas free to use,those are need database, called 'dynamic'.There are other group called 'static', no need database,the church website suppose no need to update everyday,no need a specific administrator, the 'static' apporach is good for church use. 

- Website are standard for every companies

The website market are very crowd, there are CMS like Wordpress,Druprl,Djv also has many graphic website builder like wix,shopify,many others, and many hosting companies, and there are static website companies also like netlify.com vercel.com many many, the qeastion is why they enter so much crowd market? the competition suppose to be very fierce.

The answer I think is the market big enough, every company need website, both existing companies and future companies, To have a website is a standard, may not know how helpful a website can do for sales but website is an answer to digital age.

- Website come up with digital advertising

Our mission is try to find which is best for church use in website. One thing is clear, if someone don't know how to run bsiness in digital time, he suppose don't know, cause it is only a begining,but he should not follow the previous method,the reason is simple, because the previous method can not compete with digital method.

Suppose in old generation business, you may need a permanent place, regarding working place,one may reflect office, for ones working together, if regarding sales activity, one may reflect shop, likewise, in digital time, the permanent place is website, so in digital time, website is important, it can provide information,also it can be tool for sale. 

The digital business come together with digital advertising, without digital advertising,digital business can not run properly.
